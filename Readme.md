To set up and use an SSH server in GitHub Codespaces and connect to it using Termux on Android, follow these steps:

Setting Up SSH Server in GitHub Codespaces

1. Create a Codespace: Go to your GitHub repository and create a new Codespace.


2. Install OpenSSH Server: Open the terminal in your Codespace and run the following commands to install the SSH server:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install openssh-server


3. Start the SSH Server: Start the SSH service using:

sudo service ssh start


4. Check SSH Status: Ensure the SSH server is running:

sudo service ssh status


5. Get the Codespace IP Address: Find the IP address of your Codespace by running:

hostname -I


6. Set Up SSH Keys: If you don't have an SSH key pair on your local machine, create one using:

ssh-keygen

Copy the public key to your Codespace's authorized_keys file. Use the command below in your Codespace:

echo "your-public-key" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

Replace "your-public-key" with the content of your public key (found in ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub on your local machine).


7. Configure SSH: Ensure that the SSH configuration allows key-based authentication. Edit the SSH config file (/etc/ssh/sshd_config) and make sure the following lines are present and uncommented:

PubkeyAuthentication yes
AuthorizedKeysFile %h/.ssh/authorized_keys

After making changes, restart the SSH service:

sudo service ssh restart



Connecting from Termux on Android

1. Install OpenSSH in Termux: Open Termux and install the OpenSSH package:

pkg update
pkg install openssh


2. Connect to Your Codespace: Use the SSH command with the IP address of your Codespace:

ssh user@your-codespace-ip

Replace user with the username (usually root in Codespaces) and your-codespace-ip with the actual IP address you obtained earlier.


3. Accept the Host Key: The first time you connect, you may be prompted to accept the host key. Type yes to continue.



Notes:

Public Access: Depending on your Codespace settings, you may need to configure firewall rules to allow incoming SSH connections.

Keep Alive: Since Codespaces can time out, you may want to look into settings that prevent the session from closing if you're frequently accessing it.


With these steps, you should be able to connect to your GitHub Codespace via SSH from Termux on your Android device.
